# Android Unpacker

A (hopefully) generic unpacker for packed Android apps.

##### How does it work?
<<<<<<< HEAD
The tool is a patched version of AOSP with some additional scripts.
The scripts executes the emulator and installs the APK. Following execution, it
dumps the unpacked version of the DEX using different hooks. The result is two
files, one of them should be the real dumped version of the DEX file, depending
on how the targeted packer works.
